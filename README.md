## Skin Lesion Detection:

This project uses images of a variety of skin cancer lesions to train a UNET based architecture to detect differing types of skin cancer lesions. 
It will also host the model on a website, so you can upload and view analysis of images of your own skin lesions to see your risk levels.

To run the code, run the Jupyter notebook.
